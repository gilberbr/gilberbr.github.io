		<p>Nova Kramer blames herself for the death of her mother and sister&mdash;so 
		does her father. When he moves them to Danville City to escape the 
		reminders of what they lost, Nova is thrown right back into a world 
		full of anxiety when their new neighbor, Stella, and her twin brothers 
		make it their mission to bring Nova to her knees&mdash;after all, they know 
		her secret&mdash;and blackmail is just the start.</p>
		
		<p>Kent Danville and his brothers have a secret, too&mdash;their clan is working 
		to take down a coven of witches and find the other five clans of Fae, but 
		when Nova walks into his life, the Fae can&apos;t seem to stop thinking about 
		her. He can&apos;t risk falling for the new girl&mdash;he has a soulmate out there 
		somewhere, and a mission to complete&hellip;if the coven doesn&apos;t kill him first.</p>
		
		<p>A war is brewing between the coven and the clan&mdash;each side a little less 
		human than the other&mdash;and Nova may get caught in the crossfire if she can&apos;t 
		discover the truth before the clock strikes Midnight.</p>
	
		<p>Can your heart handle this magical shifter retelling of Cinderella and 
		Prince Charming?
