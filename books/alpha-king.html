		<p>By the age of nineteen, Ryske thought he&apos;d be long gone from his pack 
		in North Carolina. As an arctic wolf shifter in a pack of red wolves, he&apos;s 
		an outcast. When he finds himself thrown into a portal to another world, 
		he&apos;s in way over his head.</p>

		<p>In a world where wolves once roamed with other shifters and mages, he 
		competes to claim the princess&apos;s hand, making him instant enemies with Dirk, 
		a lion shifter. But what choice does Ryske have other than to fight for the 
		princess when a wolf, not a lion, is destined to be crowned Alpha King?</p>
