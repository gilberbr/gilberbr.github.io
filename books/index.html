		<p>This is a series of five fairytale retellings beginning with 
		<a href="/books/fae-brothers-ever-after.html#midnight">Midnight: A Cinderella Retelling</a>. 
		Each book focuses on a different 
		Danville brother, five adopted siblings with Fae heritage. The 
		brothers were born with Destiny marks, and need to find their Fae 
		Princess who wears a corresponding crest on a necklace. It should 
		be easy, one would think, but the five clans have been destroyed 
		by the witches on Earth. The series follows the brothers as one by 
		one, Fate guides the Hound, the Gargoyle, the Fae, the Elf, and the 
		Mage to their Destinies.</p>

		<p>The six Lanshay brothers were raised since birth to become the most feared 
		of all beings in their world. As elemental assassins, there are few people who 
		would dare cross them. When one mission goes awry, secrets their elemental 
		family has kept for centuries begin to unravel their world. The Mindolin, 
		an evil, vile being bent on gaining more power has been trapped in a 
		dimensional prison, but with the aid of powerful men, he&apos;s about to be freed. 
		The brothers are the only ones who can protect their world, but they&apos;ll 
		have to find mates for their world to be saved. Will they be willing to bind 
		themselves together with a woman, even if not doing so will destroy their world?</p>
