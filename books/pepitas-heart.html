		<p>Pepita Anderson is a Magic Binder in search of a Heart, or soulmate. When 
		she turns sixteen, she only has three years to find him. If she doesn&apos;t 
		find him in time, she won&apos;t be able to combine their magic, and with 
		Pepita&apos;s magic almost inaccessible to her, she could use all the help 
		she can get. At her mother&apos;s insistence, they travel to Alaska to aid in 
		her search, but instead must face evil creatures called Sifters who have 
		declared war on the Magic Binders and attack the Magical Vortex they are 
		tasked to protect.</p>
		
		<p>Kolisis Sharp doesn&apos;t want a Heart. With one week left before his 
		nineteenth birthday he believes he&apos;s in the clear, despite his parents&apos; 
		meddling. When Kole meets Pepita, sparks fly, but not the kind their parents had 
		hoped for. He wants her gone and vows to spend every second trying to make that a 
		reality. Angry, heated sparks between them threaten to melt the snowy Alaskan 
		frontier.</p>
		
		<p>With the threat of the Sifters, Kole and Pepita must put their differences 
		aside. Can Kole come to terms with his denial of a Heart in time? Will Pepita 
		be able to strengthen her magic to defeat the evil threatening them? Or will 
		the Sifters win, gaining control of the Alaskan Vortex and throwing the world 
		into Chaos?</p>
