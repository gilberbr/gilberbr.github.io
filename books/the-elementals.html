		<h1>Book One: Life and Water</h1>
		
		<img src="/images/life-and-water-cover.jpg" style="float:left;" alt="Life and Water Book Cover">
		
		<p>The war between the Light and Dark has raged for centuries on the continent 
		of Loath. Commander Carmon Lanshay and his five brothers are the best assassins 
		the Light have, so when a Governor and his family are threatened, he and his 
		brothers are sent to bring them to safety.</p>

		<p>Immediately, their mission takes a turn for the worse, and Carmon discovers 
		that he will do pretty much anything to make it succeed, even if he has to die 
		protecting the Governor&apos;s oldest daughter, Sylee. On the other hand, Sylee would 
		rather fight for herself than let her arrogant Commander treat her and her family 
		with such callousness.</p>

		<p>With danger lurking around every corner, Carmon and Sylee will have to learn 
		to trust, and rely on, each other to save her family, and their world.</p>

		<p>Captain Drew Lanshay wants nothing to do with a mate, but when he starts seeing 
		a beautiful red head in dreams while on a job with his brothers, he decides she 
		might be beautiful enough to change his mind.</p>

		<p>Jasmine is unlike any mate Drew would have chosen. She&apos;s obstinate, fiery, and 
		won&apos;t back down from a fight. She also brings a multitude of trouble with her from 
		vampire challenges to haughty elementals.</p>

		<p>When the Vampire Overlord, leader of the vampires, sets his sights on having 
		Jasmine, it will take all the strength Drew has to keep Jasmine safe, but what 
		happens if he fails? And can the Lanshay brothers keep the ever strengthening 
		Mindolin in his prison?</p>

		<p>Captain Dalton Lanshay is positive of one thing in his life: his love for Lieutenant 
		Grace Bishop. He&apos;s determined to win her over, even with the competition given to him by 
		his brother, Chris. When Leo, the Fire elemental, requires Dalton and Grace to spend an 
		undetermined amount of time together, Dalton thinks it&apos;s his chance to win her heart.</p>

		<p>Grace Bishop is a self-proclaimed bachelorette who likes to have a good time. Captain 
		Lanshay being dropped in her lap: not a good time. The weak Captain has been suffering 
		from nightmares for weeks and has now intruded on her vacation, even if it is against his 
		will.</p>

		<p>As the Mindolin continues to grow in strength, Dalton and Grace are sent to stop an 
		alliance between their enemies, the Dark and the demons. But since it&apos;s the Fire 
		elemental handing out the job, there&apos;s bound to be pain involved. After all, Fire 
		and Air are a deadly combination.</p>

		<img src="/images/lightning-cover.jpg" style="float:left;" alt="Lightning Book Cover">
		
		<p>Captain Christopher Lanshay&apos;s favorite pastime is making jokes and being a nuisance 
		to his brothers when they are too grumpy. When the Mindolin attacks Bard&apos;s Forest, 
		separating Chris from his family, the young warrior&apos;s happy nature is put to the test.</p>

		<p>Sophie Decoya was born to be Chris&apos; enemy. When the Captain saves her from the Forest, 
		she intends to repay the favor. However, when one turn of events leads to another, the two 
		find themselves in Dark territory and Sophie finds herself helpless to help the man who saved 
		her.</p>

		<p>Hope and time are a limited commodity if Chris and Sophie want to escape the fates that have 
		been laid out before them. The Mindolin is on the rise. Can the Lanshays unite in time to take 
		him down?</p>

		Jeff can&apos;t refuse him.</p>

		<p>Tessa Carver hates Jeff, his brothers, and everything they stand for. While she wants
