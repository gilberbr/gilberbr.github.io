		<h2>Reviews for Midnight</h2>
		
		<p><a href="">Lynn Shaw<a> from <a href="https://www.2girlsandabook.com/">2 Girls & A Book</a> wrote: </p>
		
		<blockquote>Melanie Gilbert creates a symbolic retelling of Cinderella in her first Fae 
		Brothers&apos; Ever After Novel, Midnight. While there is no glass slipper or 
		evil step-mother, the cast of Midnight is representative of the classic story 
		as it is told in this modern fantasy. With the introduction of fae, shifters, 
		and other magics, Gilbert delivers a unique twist on this retelling. The 
		characters are diverse and multi-dimensional, each with their own story waiting 
		to be told. Did I mention that the fellas are hot? Well, they are smoking hot! 
		And what fairytale is complete without a villain? Gilbert&apos;s villain is a 
		ruthless snake but you have to have to admire her tenacity. Midnight is a 
		well-written, fast paced fantasy novel. I cannot wait to see what Gilbert&apos;s 
		take is on the other fairytales she tackles in this series.</blockquote>
